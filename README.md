## What is AutoForm Plus R4?
     
AutoForm Plus R4 is a software developed by AutoForm Engineering GmbH, the leading provider of software solutions for the sheet metal forming industry. AutoForm Plus R4 is a single comprehensive platform for the engineering, evaluation and improvement of sheet metal forming processes. It allows users to quantify and evaluate all planning aspects of stamped sheet metal parts, such as function, quality, lead time and cost.
     
AutoForm Plus R4 is guided by the vision of a Comprehensive Digital Process Planning system, i.e. a forming process design can be assessed in terms of function, quality, lead time and cost related criteria. The software connects these decision drivers, leading to an appropriate balance between them. In other words, AutoForm Plus R4 helps users to find the best possible forming process for their sheet metal parts.
     
AutoForm Plus R4 is designed for everyday real life applications and for high engineering throughput. It supports various formats of geometry data, such as IGES, STEP, CATIA, NX, SolidWorks, etc. It also offers bi-directional data transfer between AutoForm Plus R4 and CAD systems using the AutoForm QuickLink feature. Moreover, it has a large database of materials that users can choose from or create their own custom material using the Material Editor feature.

## What are the benefits of AutoForm Plus R4?
